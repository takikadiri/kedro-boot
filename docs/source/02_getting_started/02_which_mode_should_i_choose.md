```{tip}
- If you want to change the behaviour of ``kedro run`` (e.g. to loop over the session multiple times), see the [embedded mode]()
- If you want to call a kedro pipeline programatically in a third party application launched with its own command (eg. ``streamlit run``, ``uvicorn run``, datarobot...), see the [standalone mode]()
- if you want to serve a kedro pipeline as an API, see the [KedroBootFastapiApp]()
